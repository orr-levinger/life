    Represents a food item in the world that creatures can eat.

    Food can be either:
    1. Spawned by the environment (with infinite duration)
    2. Created from a creature's corpse (with duration proportional to the creature's size)

    Food has energy that decreases as creatures eat it. Each "bite" reduces
    energy by 1 and increases the creature's energy by 1.

    Food has a physical radius for collision detection in continuous space.
    Size is based on energy (size = energy).
